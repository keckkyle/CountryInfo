# Country Info

### Project Description
*Country Info* is an app that provides users with a list of countries and users can select a country to view more details. The app pulls data from 3 different APIs to populate the images and information: [countryflags.io](https://www.countryflags.io), [flagpedia.net](https://flagpedia.net), and [restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu). Users can also search for countries using the name, language, region, or capital city. The app features a shake device feature which will display a random country to the user. Users can also swipe back and forth through countries when they are in the details page.
